### About Me

I am a Full Stack Java Developer with over 3 years of experience in developing enterprise-level applications and microservices using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Angular**, **React**, and **AWS**. I possess strong expertise in backend development, cloud computing, microservices architecture, and database management. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging **Machine Learning** to create intelligent, data-driven solutions.

I specialize in both the **frontend** and **backend** aspects of web development, particularly using **Spring Boot** for backend services and **Angular** and **React** for responsive and dynamic frontend applications. I also have a strong focus on cloud technologies, especially **AWS**, and I actively contribute to optimizing systems and applications for performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability.

On top of my technical abilities, I have a deep interest in **Machine Learning** and **AI**. I have worked on **medical imaging projects** (like **malaria parasite detection** and **cervical cancer screening**) and have experience in using **deep learning** models like **CNNs**, **RNNs**, and **LSTMs** for various AI-based tasks.
